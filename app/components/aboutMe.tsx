      Data Analyst and Software Engineer with a passion for creating innovative
      solutions that improve work environments. While using using Excel, Power
      Bi, and a background in Mathematics to provide insights into departmental
      performance, I expanded my toolkit to software development, including Ruby
      on Rails, JavaScript, React, and NodeJS, when I recognized a need for
      effective software at my workplace. I bring strong skills in problem
      solving and analytics that help companies exceed goals while cutting
